## Goal

A contributor can inspect a third-project morphology observation without treating it as an automatic deciding vote.

## Context

- Architecture: `docs/architecture/README.md`; blueprint §§7.1, 10, 14, 22 and the refs above.
- Research: `docs/content/research-report.md`, `docs/content/entry-specification.md`, `docs/content/verification-pipeline.md`.
- Related decisions: `docs/adr/0003-woorden-scope-and-adaptation.md`; `docs/adr/0005-source-and-ai-content-review.md` (accepted).
- Existing T-001 is done (repository inspected 2026-10-03); reuse its immutable seed and tooling conventions.
- Research data, packets, schemas and Python prototypes: `research/content-2026-10/` (see its `README.md`).

## Scope

In:

- Read active XML section entries and selected paradigm gender/separability features.
- Produce disagreement rows including landbouw and retain raw paradigm IDs and lineage caveats.

Out (do not do in this task):

- Regex-counting commented entries, replacing primary forms, or declaring projects statistically independent.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] AC1: Given active versus commented entries, when imported, then only active XML entries are counted. (unit)
- [ ] AC2: Given conflicting landbouw gender, when compared, then the conflict is surfaced and no automatic correction is applied. (unit)

## Notes for the implementer

Keep this one reviewable PR. Port/reuse the research algorithms in the repository's TypeScript/CLI conventions; the research Python scripts are evidence/prototypes, not a new runtime dependency. Prefix tests with relevant blueprint IDs. Run the repository's required verification gates for changed behavior; never record an unexecuted gate as passed. Preserve source text, IDs and review provenance. Do not edit protected agent/workflow files or introduce legacy progress migration. Stop to split implementation if it exceeds the repository's S/M logic budget; large fixed data fixtures do not justify a larger behavioral scope.

Source files: the pinned downloads come from hosts outside the Codex environment's default
allowlist (see "Content backlog" in `docs/tasks/README.md`). Unit tests run on small excerpts
committed under `tests/fixtures/content-sources/` (cut from the pinned file, keeping its record
hashes), never on the network. Criteria that count rows in a full file are proven by the import
command's report run against the pinned download: paste that report into the PR body. If the
download is blocked, open the PR as a draft and say so.

## Notes for the reviewer

Check the observable acceptance criteria, exact evidence/units and failure paths. Source support is not linguistic approval; imported drafts cannot self-certify. Confirm no credentials, model call, hidden network fallback, source erasure or fabricated review appears in the app/tooling. Content review in Claude must be an actual separately recorded operation on the exact payload; a code review alone does not imply all Dutch text passed the language rubric.
