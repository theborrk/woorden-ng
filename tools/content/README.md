# Local source inspection

`content:sources` records original file bytes without downloads or lexical extraction. For an
initial pin, provide JSON metadata with `source_id`, `url`, `retrieved_at`, `format`, `version`
and `lineage`, as in `tests/fixtures/content-sources/metadata.json`:

```sh
npm --silent run content:sources -- inspect tests/fixtures/content-sources/nt2lex-excerpt.tsv --metadata tests/fixtures/content-sources/metadata.json
```

The JSON report adds `schema_version`, `bytes` and `sha256` and follows
`content/schemas/source-manifest.schema.json`. Save the report as the expected manifest and
check later copies with:

```sh
npm --silent run content:sources -- inspect tests/fixtures/content-sources/nt2lex-excerpt.tsv --expected tests/fixtures/content-sources/manifest.json
```

Only a successful inspection prints a manifest. A mismatch exits with status 1 and a diagnostic
on stderr, leaving the input and expected manifest untouched. The command does not save or adopt
files. Avoid redirecting stdout onto an existing pin: shell redirection truncates it before the
command runs. Hashing streams the raw bytes, including compression, encoding and line endings.
Paths and current time do not enter the manifest.

Allocate `source_id` once for a named snapshot; keep it when relocating files. Record the actual
retrieval timestamp with timezone, declared file format and source version (use an explicit
`unknown` if unavailable). `lineage` lists upstream source families/snapshots, including inherited
corpora; an empty array states that no upstream lineage is known. These are contributor-supplied
provenance, not inferred factual or linguistic approval. The initial inspection measures bytes;
it cannot establish completeness without a trusted expected pin. Format-specific parsing,
decompression and row validation belong to the later importers.
